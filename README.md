# Xpert Forex Trade

A simple PHP MVC starter for a forex trading platform supporting spot and futures trading.

## Features
- User login
- Spot and futures trade placement
- Trade dashboard
- MVC structure (Models, Views, Controllers)
- MySQL database integration

## Project Structure
- `app/Controllers` - Handles user and trade actions
- `app/Models` - Database logic
- `app/Views` - HTML templates
- `config/config.php` - Loads DB settings from `.env`
- `public/index.php` - Front controller and router
- `.env.example` - Sample environment config

## Getting Started
1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your database details.
2. Create the database and tables:
    - `users` (id, username, password, etc.)
    - `trades` (id, user_id, pair, amount, direction, type, created_at)
3. Point your web server to `public/index.php`
4. Start building!

## Setting Up Secure Credentials

After setting up your database, you will need to create an admin user with secure credentials. Follow these steps:

1. Access your database management tool.
2. Navigate to the `users` table.
3. Insert a new record with the following fields:
   - **Username:** Choose a secure username (e.g., `admin_yourname`).
   - **Password:** Use a strong password generated by a password manager.
4. Save the record.

Avoid using generic or default credentials for better security.

## Security
- Do NOT commit your real `.env` file.
- Add `.env` to `.gitignore`.
- Always validate user input in production!
