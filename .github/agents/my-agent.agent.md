# My Agent

This agent helps contributors work efficiently within the **xpert-hostinger** project by:

- Generating modular, audit‑friendly code templates for both frontend (React/TS) and backend (Node/Express).
- Assisting with API route design, validation schemas, controllers, and service‑layer logic.
- Providing step‑by‑step debugging support for Docker, migrations, environment setup, and deployment.
- Creating branded documentation, onboarding guides, and workflow explanations.
- Enforcing project structure, naming conventions, and contributor standards.
- Offering architectural recommendations that align with XPERT GLOBAL SYSTEMS™ governance.

Its purpose is to accelerate development, maintain consistency, and empower contributors with clear, actionable guidance across the entire stack.
